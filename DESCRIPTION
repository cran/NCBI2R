Description: This annotates lists of SNPs and/or genes, with current information
        from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S.A.). 
        Functions are provided that with one command will provide annotation of 
        the results from genome wide association studies to provide a broader 
        context of their meaning. Other functions enable comparisons between a 
        user's GWA results, and candidate snp/gene lists that are created from 
        keywords, such as specific diseases, phenotypes or gene ontology terms. 
        Commands are simple to follow and designed to work with R objects to 
        integrate into existing workflows. The output produces text fields and 
        weblinks to more information for items such as: gene descriptions, 
        nucleotide positions, OMIM, pathways, phenotypes, and lists of 
        interacting and neighboring genes. Annotation can then be used in R for 
        further analysis, or the objects can be customized for use in 
        spreadsheet programs or web browsers for users not familiar with R. 
        Please see the website at http://NCBI2R.wordpress.com for more information. 
        Internet access is required for almost all of these functions. Use the 
        function PrintNCBI2RInfo() for information.
